# Adding a host to an existing PBS nightly backup schedule

Use this when a new LXC/VM needs to join an existing Proxmox Backup Server datastore's nightly
backup rotation (as opposed to setting up PBS or a datastore from scratch — that's a bigger,
one-time task). Verified end-to-end adding the Homepage dashboard (VMID 140) to an existing
`pihole-and-friends` datastore already backing up Pi-hole and Home Assistant.

## Create the job via `pvesh`, not by hand-editing `/etc/pve/jobs.cfg`

`pvesh` is available directly on the Proxmox host (`pve`) even though it isn't installed on the
PBS host itself — backup jobs are configured cluster-side (`/etc/pve/jobs.cfg`), not on PBS.
Match whatever schedule offset and retention the existing jobs already use rather than
inventing new values:

```bash
# Check what's already scheduled first, so the new job doesn't collide:
pvesh get /cluster/backup --output-format json

pvesh create /cluster/backup \
  --vmid <new-vmid> \
  --storage <existing-pbs-storage-name> \
  --mode snapshot \
  --schedule 'sun..sat HH:MM' \
  --enabled 1 \
  --comment '<Host> nightly backup to PBS' \
  --prune-backups keep-daily=7,keep-weekly=4
```

Stagger the schedule time a few minutes after the last existing job in the same datastore (e.g.
`03:00`, `03:15`, `03:20`) rather than running them concurrently.

## Always manually trigger the new job once — don't just wait for the cron schedule

A scheduled job succeeding tonight doesn't confirm the *prune* step works (see the gotcha below;
prune can fail silently in a way that only shows up in the task log, not as a missing backup).
Trigger it for real and read the full output:

```bash
vzdump <vmid> --storage <storage> --mode snapshot --prune-backups keep-daily=7,keep-weekly=4
```

Look for `Backup job finished successfully` at the end, not just `Duration: ...` after the
upload — a failed prune still uploads the backup fine and only fails on the line after.

## Gotcha — the backup service account can lack `Datastore.Prune`, and this fails silently per-job, not fleet-wide

A PBS service account scoped with only `DatastoreReader` + `DatastoreBackup` (a reasonable-looking
least-privilege choice) can successfully upload backups indefinitely while **every prune step
fails**:

```
ERROR: prune 'ct/<vmid>': proxmox-backup-client failed: Error: permission check failed - missing Datastore.Modify|Datastore.Prune on /datastore/<name>
INFO: Backup job finished with errors
```

This is easy to miss because the backup itself (the part anyone actually checks — "did last
night's backup run?") succeeds every time; only the prune line fails, silently accumulating
backups past the configured retention. **This is a shared-account permission, so if it's missing
it's missing for every job on that datastore, not just the new one** — check by manually
triggering an *existing* job (e.g. the oldest one) after the fix, not just the new one, to
confirm the fix actually resolved a fleet-wide gap rather than something scoped to the new host.

Fix: grant `DatastorePowerUser` (read + backup + prune + verify — the PBS role designed
specifically for an automated backup account that also manages its own retention) on the
datastore path:

```bash
proxmox-backup-manager acl update /datastore/<name> DatastorePowerUser --auth-id <backup-user>@pbs
```

`acl update` is additive — it doesn't need the old narrower roles removed first, though they
become redundant once `DatastorePowerUser` is in place.

**This is a permission escalation on a shared credential, not a scoped fix for one job** — it
affects every existing backup job using that account. Flag it and get explicit confirmation
before applying, don't fix it silently as a side effect of an unrelated task.

## Excluding one mount point from backup (e.g. a bulky media/data volume)

A container with a separate large data mount (media library, scratch data, anything bulky and
reproducible from elsewhere) usually shouldn't have that volume backed up nightly alongside the
small rootfs — it wastes datastore space backing up content that isn't actually irreplaceable.
Proxmox supports this per-mount-point, not just per-container:

```bash
pct set <vmid> -mp0 local-zfs:subvol-<vmid>-disk-1,mp=/mnt/media,size=500G,backup=0
```

Proxmox's default for a *volume* mount point (as opposed to a bind-mount of an existing host
directory) is backed-up-by-default when the `backup` flag is absent — you have to set
`backup=0` explicitly to exclude it. If provisioning this container via Terraform's
`bpg/proxmox` provider, **don't trust `mount_point.backup = false` in the `.tf` config alone** —
see that skill's Gotcha 11: the attribute can be recorded in Terraform state without the real
`backup=0` flag landing in `/etc/pve/lxc/<vmid>.conf`. Always verify directly:

```bash
grep ^mp0 /etc/pve/lxc/<vmid>.conf   # must show `,backup=0` explicitly
```

Confirm the exclusion actually works by triggering a real backup and reading the log, not just
the config file — the log line makes it unambiguous:

```
INFO: including mount point rootfs ('/') in backup
INFO: excluding volume mount point mp0 ('/mnt/media') from backup (disabled)
```

If a mount point isn't irreplaceable (e.g. it holds the only copy of something), don't exclude it
from backup without a separate backup plan for that content — flag this explicitly rather than
silently trading data safety for datastore space.

## A datastore needs a `gc-schedule` set explicitly — it is not on by default

Creating a PBS datastore (`proxmox-backup-manager datastore create`) does **not** set up
automatic garbage collection. Per-job `--prune-backups` only updates snapshot *metadata*
(marks old snapshots for removal per retention) — it does not reclaim the underlying chunk-store
disk space. Without a scheduled GC, deleted/superseded chunks accumulate forever and the
datastore can silently fill to 100%, causing every subsequent backup job to fail with `No space
left on device`, even though retention/pruning has been "working" the whole time. Check with:

```bash
proxmox-backup-manager datastore show <name>   # look for a gc-schedule row; if absent, none is set
```

Fix — set one at datastore creation time, not as an afterthought:

```bash
proxmox-backup-manager datastore update <name> --gc-schedule 'sun 04:00'
```

**GC is two-phase and won't reclaim space on its first run after a big deletion.** Phase 1 marks
chunks referenced by *current* backup indices; phase 2 sweeps everything else, but only actually
deletes chunks whose access-time is *older* than a safety cutoff (default ~1 day + 5 min) — chunks
touched more recently are left as "pending removal" to avoid racing a backup that's still
mid-upload. A GC run right after deleting several groups can report `Removed garbage: 0 B` while
also reporting `Pending removals: NN GiB` — this is expected, not a bug; a second GC run once the
cutoff clears (usually within ~24h of the chunks' last real use) actually frees the space. Don't
assume GC "didn't work" from a 0 B removal on the first pass — check `Pending removals` in the
output.

## Monitor datastore disk usage — a full datastore fails every job at once with no advance warning

Nothing about `pvesh get /cluster/backup` or a single job's own history surfaces that the
*datastore itself* is nearly full — every guest's job just starts failing with `No space left on
device` the night it tips over 100%, with no warning the nights before. If a nightly/weekly
backup-status check doesn't already cover this, add a `df -h <datastore-path>` (or the PBS API's
datastore status endpoint) threshold check (e.g. warn at 80%, fail at 90%) — this is the single
highest-leverage check for catching the failure mode below before it happens, rather than
diagnosing it after the fact. Hit this for real 2026-07-19: `pihole-and-friends` hit 100% used
(93GB/98GB) overnight, failing Homepage/n8n/Immich's jobs simultaneously; root cause was two
compounding gaps — no `gc-schedule` (above) plus stale backups for four services decommissioned
days earlier never pruned (see next section) — neither of which any monitoring caught until
backups actually started failing. The homelab project's nightly backup summary
(`backup-status-checks.sh`) now implements exactly this check (added same day) — use it as a
reference implementation (a plain `df --output=pcent`/`--output=avail` SSH call, two thresholds,
feeding into the same overall-status/follow-up-prompt machinery as its per-job checks) rather
than reinventing the shape for a new project.

## When decommissioning a guest, its PBS backups don't disappear with it — decide on them explicitly

Destroying a VM/LXC via Terraform/`pct destroy`/`qm destroy` does **not** touch its existing PBS
backups — they sit in the datastore under their own group (`ct/<vmid>` or `vm/<vmid>`) consuming
real disk space indefinitely, since nothing is left to trigger their retention-based pruning
(that only happens as a side effect of a *new* backup running via `--prune-backups`, which will
never happen again for a destroyed guest). "Let them age out naturally per retention" is not
actually true for a decommissioned guest — there is no more pruning happening, so they simply sit
there consuming datastore capacity forever unless removed explicitly. Delete a decommissioned
guest's backup group via the PBS API (no CLI subcommand exists for this as of this writing):

```bash
# from the PBS host itself, using a scoped API token (create one, grant DatastoreAdmin
# on /datastore/<name>, delete both when done — see below)
curl -sk -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: PBSAPIToken=<tokenid>:<secret>" \
  "https://localhost:8007/api2/json/admin/datastore/<name>/groups?backup-type=<ct|vm>&backup-id=<vmid>"
# response: {"data":{"protected-snapshots":0,"removed-groups":1,"removed-snapshots":N}}
```

If you don't already have a token scoped for datastore admin, mint a short-lived one and delete
it again afterward rather than widening a long-lived credential's scope:

```bash
proxmox-backup-manager user generate-token root@pam housekeeping-tmp --comment '<why, and expected deletion>'
proxmox-backup-manager acl update /datastore/<name> DatastoreAdmin --auth-id 'root@pam!housekeeping-tmp'
# ... do the deletes ...
proxmox-backup-manager acl update /datastore/<name> DatastoreAdmin --auth-id 'root@pam!housekeeping-tmp' --delete
proxmox-backup-manager user delete-token root@pam housekeeping-tmp
```

This is a real, deliberate decision point, not a formality — add "prune PBS backups for the
decommissioned guest (or explicitly note you're keeping them and for how long)" to whatever
decommission checklist you're following, alongside the already-standard Prometheus/Homepage/
Pi-hole-DNS/Tailscale-device cleanup steps. Run GC (above) afterward to actually reclaim the
freed chunks.

**Checking whether a group exists at all doesn't need a token.** Before minting a temp
DatastoreAdmin token just to *check*, it's simpler to look at the datastore's own directory
layout directly (root SSH to the PBS host is enough — no API, no token):

```bash
ssh pbs "find /<datastore-path>/vm /<datastore-path>/ct -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d"
# e.g. /mnt/pbs-datastore/vm/145, /mnt/pbs-datastore/ct/101 -- the trailing number is the vmid
```

Each backup group is just a `vm/<vmid>` or `ct/<vmid>` directory — `grep` the output for the
vmid you care about. Reserve the token-minting dance above for the actual delete, once you've
confirmed via this read-only check that there's something to delete. Used this in
`homelab-ansible/scripts/decommission-touchpoint-check.sh` (see the homelab's
`project_ansible_graduation_catalog` memory) — also where a variable named `GROUPS` turned out
to silently misbehave (it's a bash built-in special variable, an array of the process's Unix
groups); name it something else.

## Setting up a second, physically separate PBS instance as a pulled replica (Remote + Sync Job)

Full workflow verified end-to-end 2026-08-27 building a resilience-node replica: a fresh PBS
install pulling a copy of an existing datastore from a primary PBS instance, then restore-tested
for real. Applies whether the replica is another Proxmox VM or, as here, bare-metal (any Debian
box `apt install proxmox-backup-server` on).

**Direction matters — the replica runs the Sync Job, not the primary.** PBS Sync Jobs *pull*:
whichever instance holds the destination datastore is the one that must have the Remote (pointing
at the source) and the Sync Job configured on it. Configuring the Remote+Sync Job on the primary
instead (pointing at the replica) pulls data the wrong direction. `--sync-direction` defaults to
`pull`; leave it that way.

```bash
# On the REPLICA (destination) instance:
# 1. Create a dedicated least-privilege user+token on the PRIMARY (source):
proxmox-backup-manager user create sync-replica@pbs --comment "read-only, used by <replica> sync job"
proxmox-backup-manager user generate-token sync-replica@pbs <token-name> --comment "..."
# See the token-permission gotcha below -- grant the ACL to BOTH the user and the token:
proxmox-backup-manager acl update /datastore/<name> DatastoreReader --auth-id 'sync-replica@pbs'
proxmox-backup-manager acl update /datastore/<name> DatastoreReader --auth-id 'sync-replica@pbs!<token-name>'

# 2. Get the primary's cert fingerprint (self-signed, needed to register the Remote):
proxmox-backup-manager cert info | grep -i fingerprint

# 3. On the replica: register the primary as a Remote, then create the Sync Job:
proxmox-backup-manager remote create <remote-name> --host <primary-ip> --port 8007 \
  --auth-id 'sync-replica@pbs!<token-name>' --password '<token-secret>' --fingerprint '<fp>'
proxmox-backup-manager sync-job create <job-id> --store <replica-datastore> \
  --remote <remote-name> --remote-store <primary-datastore> \
  --schedule '06:00' --remove-vanished true
proxmox-backup-manager sync-job run <job-id>   # trigger once manually, don't just wait for cron
```

`--remove-vanished true` keeps the replica's retention actually tracking the primary's pruning
instead of accumulating independently — matches the whole point of it being a *replica*, not a
second, separately-retained archive. Set `gc-schedule` on the new datastore too (see the section
above) — a fresh datastore is exactly as exposed to the "never had a gc-schedule" incident as
the original was.

**Use the primary's LAN IP for the Remote, not its Tailscale hostname**, if the replica's own
DNS resolution doesn't go through something Tailscale-aware (e.g. it points at a plain Pi-hole
that only does recursive resolution, not MagicDNS). `*.ts.net` names don't resolve through a
generic recursive resolver — confirmed 2026-08-27, `Querying namespaces failed - client error
(Connect)` when the remote's `--host` was a `.ts.net` name the replica genuinely couldn't
resolve. Both instances on the same LAN subnet makes this moot anyway; use the IP.

### Gotcha — a PBS API token's permissions are capped by its *parent user's own* ACL, not just the token's

Granting an ACL to the token itself (`user@realm!tokenname`) is not sufficient on its own — if
the owning user (`user@realm`) has zero ACL entries of its own, the token's effective
permissions are also zero, **even though the token's own ACL entry looks completely correct**.
Confirmed 2026-08-27: `sync-job run` failed with `Querying namespaces failed - HTTP error 403
Forbidden - permission check failed`, and `curl`ing `/api2/json/access/permissions` directly with
the token returned `{"data":{}}` — an authenticated (200 OK) but *empty* permission set — despite
`proxmox-backup-manager acl list` clearly showing the token's own `DatastoreReader` grant on the
right path. Fix confirmed: grant the **same role to the plain user**, not just the token
(`proxmox-backup-manager acl update /datastore/<name> DatastoreReader --auth-id 'sync-replica@pbs'`,
no `!tokenname` suffix) — permissions immediately populated correctly afterward. Always grant
both when creating a scoped service token from scratch; a token-only grant that "looks right" in
`acl list` will still silently produce zero access.

### Gotcha — `proxmox-backup-server`'s own postinst adds the paid enterprise repo, which 401s on a no-subscription install

A fresh `apt install proxmox-backup-server` can leave
`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pbs-enterprise.sources` in place (pointing at
`https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/pbs`), which requires a paid subscription — every
subsequent `apt update` fails outright with `401 Unauthorized`, blocking *all* package updates on
the host, not just PBS's own. An existing no-subscription PBS install elsewhere in the same fleet
may never have hit this (e.g. if it was built by a slightly different install sequence) — don't
assume a sibling host's clean `apt update` means this file won't be present on a new one; check
`ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d/` directly. Fix: `rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pbs-enterprise.sources`
— the `pbs-no-subscription` repo (set up separately per the standard no-subscription install
steps) is sufficient on its own.

### Restore-testing a replica for real, not just trusting "sync completed"

A sync job reporting success only proves bytes transferred, not that they're restorable. Prove
it with an actual restore to a throwaway VMID/CTID on a real Proxmox host, then tear it down:

```bash
# On a Proxmox VE host (pve), add the PBS replica as a temporary storage backend:
pvesm add pbs <temp-storage-name> --server <replica-ip> --port 8007 \
  --username '<user>@pbs!<token>' --password '<token-secret>' \
  --datastore <replica-datastore> --fingerprint '<replica-cert-fingerprint>'
pvesm list <temp-storage-name>   # confirm real snapshot history is visible

# Restore the most recent snapshot of some small, low-risk guest to an unused VMID:
pct restore 999 '<temp-storage-name>:backup/ct/<vmid>/<timestamp>' \
  --storage local-zfs --unprivileged 1 --hostname restore-test-999
pct set 999 --net0 name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,firewall=1,ip=dhcp,type=veth   # fresh MAC, no hwaddr specified
pct start 999
pct exec 999 -- systemctl is-active <the-guest's-main-service>   # confirm it's genuinely running, not just booted

# Clean up immediately -- this was a throwaway, not a new permanent guest:
pct stop 999 && pct destroy 999
pvesm remove <temp-storage-name>
proxmox-backup-manager user remove <temp-restore-test-user>@pbs   # if a separate scoped user was minted for this
```

Confirming a real service is `active` inside the restored container (not just that `pct start`
returned success) is what actually proves the backup is usable — a container can boot with a
corrupted or incomplete application config and still show as "running." Explicitly not
specifying `hwaddr` on the `--net0` re-set generates a fresh random MAC, avoiding the known
MAC-conflict issue from restoring a VM/CT backup with its original network identity still
attached while the real guest is also running (see the homelab's Tailscale gotchas for the `qm`
equivalent of this).
