description: This skill should be used when working on a Cloudflare Pages project with Pages Functions — debugging on-the-fly image resizing that won't work, a wrangler.toml with named [env.*] blocks where bindings mysteriously go missing in one environment, a crypto.subtle PBKDF2 call that throws in production but works locally, or a _redirects rule that silently never fires on a path a Function also handles. Trigger phrases include "pages images binding", "env.IMAGES", "wrangler.toml env production", "bindings missing in production", "PBKDF2 iterations error", "NotSupportedError iteration counts", "_redirects not working", "redirect skipped by functions", "pages function precedence".

# Cloudflare Pages + Wrangler Gotchas

Four real, non-obvious platform behaviors hit while building and deploying a
Cloudflare Pages site with Functions, KV, and R2. Each looked like a bug in
the project's own code at first; each was actually a documented (but easy to
miss) platform constraint.

## Pages Functions have NO Images binding — at all, ever

`env.IMAGES` (the on-the-fly image transform API) is unsupported on
Cloudflare Pages, full stop:

- `wrangler.toml`: an `[images]` block fails config validation on a Pages
  project.
- Dashboard: Images isn't in the Pages bindings list at all (it exists for
  Workers, not Pages).

This is a hard platform limit, not a config mistake to debug around.
**Solution: pre-generate the responsive/derivative images you need (WebP,
AVIF, thumbnails, etc.) at build or ingest time and serve them as plain R2
objects** — don't design around an on-the-fly resize step for Pages.
(Workers *do* support the Images binding; only Pages doesn't. `keep_vars` is
similarly Workers-only and will fail on a Pages project.)

## Empty `[env.production]` / `[env.preview]` blocks silently drop top-level bindings

In `wrangler.toml`, declaring *any* named environment block — even an empty
one — stops Wrangler from inheriting top-level `kv_namespaces` / `r2_buckets`
/ other bindings into that environment. The result: `pages deploy` (or a
branch deploy) ships with **no bindings at all**, and every Function that
touches one 500s in production while working fine locally.

```toml
# BAD — this empty block silently drops top-level bindings from prod:
[env.production]

# GOOD — no named env blocks at all; top-level bindings apply to every deploy
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "MY_KV"
id = "..."
```

Wrangler does print a warning about this during deploy, but still deploys
successfully — easy to miss in CI logs. Fix is simply deleting the empty
`[env.*]` blocks so the top-level config applies to all deploys (production
and preview alike).

## Workers' `crypto.subtle` caps PBKDF2 at 100,000 iterations

`crypto.subtle.deriveBits`/`deriveKey` with PBKDF2 throws
`NotSupportedError: iteration counts above 100000 are not supported` on
real Workers/Pages Functions — but **not** in `wrangler dev` or Miniflare,
which use Node's crypto implementation with no such cap. Code hashing at a
higher iteration count (210,000, matching some published bcrypt/PBKDF2
guidance) will pass every local test and then 500 on every request in
production.

**Lesson: PBKDF2/crypto.subtle behavior must be verified against a real
deploy, not just local dev** — Node-vs-workerd crypto differences hide this
kind of bug completely locally. If you store the iteration count alongside
each hash (e.g. `iterations` field in the stored credential), fixing a
too-high count is just re-hashing existing values, not a schema migration.

## `_redirects` is silently skipped for any path a Pages Functions route matches

Cloudflare's own docs: *"Redirects defined in the `_redirects` file are not
applied to requests served by Pages Functions, even if the Function route
matches the URL pattern."* This applies even when the matching function's
only job for that path is to call `next()` and pass through — the mere
existence of a matching Functions route is enough to disable `_redirects`
for that path.

**Practical impact: a root `functions/_middleware.ts` (which matches every
request) means `_redirects` never fires anywhere on that project, for any
path.** If you need a redirect (e.g. a renamed page/slug) on a Pages project
that has a catch-all middleware, implement the redirect *inside* the
middleware itself — checking `url.pathname` and returning
`Response.redirect(...)` — rather than relying on `_redirects` at all.
