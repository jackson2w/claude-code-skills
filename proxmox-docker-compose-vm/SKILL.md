# Docker Compose stack in a Proxmox VM (not an LXC)

Use this when an app's *only* supported deployment path is Docker Compose — no native
package, no bare-metal tarball (unlike e.g. Paperless-ngx, which has one). This homelab
otherwise avoids Docker everywhere (Grafana, Homepage, n8n, Jellyfin, Paperless-ngx all run
as native systemd services specifically to dodge Docker-in-unprivileged-LXC cgroup quirks —
see the `proxmox-node-systemd-service` skill). When Docker is genuinely unavoidable, run it
in a **VM**, not an LXC, and contain the exception there rather than fighting cgroups. Built
and verified end-to-end deploying Immich (`immich-app/immich`, VMID 145, v3.0.3) — every
gotcha below was hit for real, not theoretical.

**VM creation itself** (cloud-init staleness, `qemu-guest-agent` needed before
`generate-config-out`, cleaning up the generated Terraform config) is covered by the
`proxmox-terraform-provisioning` skill, not repeated here — this skill picks up once the VM
exists and boots with working networking.

## Install sequence

1. **Docker CE + Compose plugin from Docker's official apt repo**, not the Debian repo
   (`docker.io` package) or a distro-bundled `docker-compose` — Compose v2 (the `docker
   compose` subcommand, not the legacy hyphenated `docker-compose` binary) is what modern
   Compose files assume:

   ```yaml
   - name: Add Docker GPG key
     ansible.builtin.get_url:
       url: https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg
       dest: /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
       mode: '0644'

   - name: Add Docker apt repository (deb822)
     ansible.builtin.copy:
       content: |
         Types: deb
         URIs: https://download.docker.com/linux/debian
         Suites: {{ ansible_distribution_release }}
         Components: stable
         Architectures: amd64
         Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
       dest: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.sources
       mode: '0644'
     register: docker_repo

   - name: Install Docker CE + Compose plugin
     ansible.builtin.apt:
       name: [docker-ce, docker-ce-cli, containerd.io, docker-buildx-plugin, docker-compose-plugin]
       state: present
       update_cache: "{{ docker_repo.changed }}"
   ```

2. **A dedicated second disk for Docker volumes, not the OS disk**, if the app stores real
   data (photo library, database). Format and mount it, then point the app's data paths at
   it:

   ```yaml
   - name: Check if data disk is already formatted
     ansible.builtin.command: "blkid {{ data_disk }}"   # e.g. /dev/sdb
     register: data_disk_blkid
     failed_when: false
     changed_when: false

   - name: Format data disk (ext4)
     community.general.filesystem:
       fstype: ext4
       dev: "{{ data_disk }}"
     when: data_disk_blkid.rc != 0

   - name: Mount data disk (persistent via fstab)
     ansible.posix.mount:
       path: "{{ data_mount }}"
       src: "{{ data_disk }}"
       fstype: ext4
       state: mounted
   ```

   Confirm the disk device name from inside the guest first (`lsblk`) rather than assuming
   `/dev/sdb` — it follows creation order of the VM's SCSI disks (`scsi0` → `sda`, `scsi1` →
   `sdb`, etc.), which is predictable but worth a direct check, not an assumption.

3. **Fetch the app's real `docker-compose.yml`/`.env.example` from its release tag**, don't
   hand-write one from memory or an older cached version — Compose file structure and image
   names change between major versions (Immich's v3 line switched its Redis image to Valkey
   and its Postgres image name/tag, for example):

   ```bash
   gh api "repos/<org>/<repo>/contents/docker/docker-compose.yml?ref=v<version>" --jq '.content' | base64 -d
   ```

   Commit the file into the Ansible repo (`files/<app>/docker-compose.yml`) as close to
   verbatim as possible, documenting any deliberate deviation in a comment (see Gotcha 1
   below for the one deviation this skill requires).

4. **Render secrets via a `.env` Jinja2 template, not a committed plaintext file** — same
   pattern as this fleet's other apps (n8n's encryption key, Immich's DB password): generate
   once with `openssl rand -hex <n>` into a root-owned `600` file on the Ansible control node,
   read it via a `lookup('file', ...)` var, template it into `.env` on the target host with
   mode `'0600'`. Never print the generated secret to stdout/chat.

## Gotcha 1 — Compose's short-form `ports:` publishes to `0.0.0.0` by default

```yaml
# WRONG -- reachable on the plain LAN IP too, not just Tailscale
ports:
  - '2283:2283'

# RIGHT
ports:
  - '127.0.0.1:2283:2283'
```

Same "binds everywhere by default" family as Next.js/Jellyfin's LAN-binding gotcha (see
`proxmox-node-systemd-service`), just via Docker's port-publishing syntax instead of an
app-level CLI flag or config value. `docker compose ps`/`docker ps` show the mapping as if
it's fine either way — nothing looks wrong until a negative reachability check from another
LAN host succeeds when it shouldn't (see Verification below). This is the one deliberate
deviation from the upstream Compose file worth noting in a comment when committing it.

Confirm the fix landed with `ss -tlnp | grep <port>` on the host after `docker compose up` —
look for `127.0.0.1:<port>` in the listen address, not `0.0.0.0:<port>` — before trusting the
Compose file diff alone.

## Gotcha 2 — container health does not prove an async first-run job actually worked

`docker compose ps` reporting every container `healthy` only proves the *processes* are up —
it says nothing about whether an app's own background pipeline (ML indexing, search
embedding, thumbnail generation, etc.) has actually run for real data yet. Concretely: an
asset uploaded to Immich via a raw API call got a thumbnail immediately, but its smart-search
(CLIP embedding) job never auto-queued the way it does for uploads through the normal
mobile/web client flow — `GET /api/jobs` showed `waiting: 0, active: 0, completed: 0` for
`smartSearch` indefinitely, with no error anywhere.

**Verify the feature, not just the job queue.** If a job queue shows nothing queued for an
action that should have triggered one, don't assume it's fine — either replicate through the
app's real client flow, or manually trigger the job via its admin API (Immich:
`PUT /api/jobs/<jobName>` with `{"command":"start","force":true}`) and then confirm the
*downstream effect*, not just that the queue drained: e.g. run the actual search query and
check the expected asset comes back, rather than trusting `jobCounts.completed` incrementing
alone (queue "completed" counters are often not retained for long in BullMQ-style queues, so
`completed: 0` after a job clearly ran isn't itself evidence of failure — check the real
output instead).

## Gotcha 3 — hardware acceleration is often already anticipated, just commented out

Before writing custom `devices:`/image-tag config for GPU acceleration from scratch, check
whether the upstream Compose file already anticipates it — Immich's does, via commented-out
`extends:` stanzas referencing separate release-artifact files:

```yaml
services:
  immich-machine-learning:
    image: ghcr.io/immich-app/immich-machine-learning:${IMMICH_VERSION:-release}
    # extends: # uncomment this section for hardware acceleration
    #   file: hwaccel.ml.yml
    #   service: cpu # set to one of [armnn, cuda, rocm, openvino, openvino-wsl, rknn]
```

`hwaccel.ml.yml`/`hwaccel.transcoding.yml` aren't in the repo checkout — they're separate
release-tagged download artifacts (`.../releases/download/<version>/hwaccel.ml.yml`) that
define the actual `devices:`/`deploy:` blocks per backend as named service fragments. To wire
up Intel iGPU acceleration: download both files pinned to the **same version** already in use
(mismatched versions can disagree on service/device shape), uncomment the `extends:` block
targeting `openvino` (ML) / `vaapi` (transcoding), and — separately from the `extends:`, which
only adds `devices: [/dev/dri:/dev/dri]` — switch the ML image tag itself to the accelerated
variant (`immich-machine-learning:<version>-openvino`, not just `<version>`); the `extends:`
block alone doesn't change which image ships, only its runtime device access. Deploy the two
downloaded files as static, version-controlled Ansible files (same pattern as
`docker-compose.yml` itself), not a one-off manual `curl` on the VM.

This assumes the GPU device is actually present in the VM in the first place — see the
`proxmox-vm-igpu-passthrough` skill for getting `/dev/dri` to exist at all inside a VM guest
(materially more involved than an LXC, which gets it for free via the host's kernel).

## Gotcha 4 — public sharing: use a purpose-built proxy sidecar, not a partial-path Funnel to the app itself

If an app needs to expose *one specific feature* to people outside the tailnet (Immich's
"share a link with someone who's not on my tailnet") while staying otherwise tailnet-only,
the instinct is to Tailscale-Funnel just that one path on the app's own port (the pattern
that works fine for a pure-API endpoint like n8n's `/webhook`). **This doesn't work for a
page that's part of a real frontend app**: Immich's `/share/:key` page is a SvelteKit route
that needs `/api/*` calls to load thumbnails/metadata client-side, so Funneling only
`/share` still leaves the page broken, and Funneling `/api/*` too punches a hole to the
*entire* authenticated API surface — confirmed via Immich's own reverse-proxy docs and a
GitHub discussion before building anything, not assumed.

**Fix: deploy a dedicated, purpose-built proxy sidecar as its own Compose service**, and
Funnel *that*, not the app. For Immich specifically:
[`alangrainger/immich-public-proxy`](https://github.com/alangrainger/immich-public-proxy)
(Docker Hub, pin a version tag e.g. `3.0.2`, not `:latest`) — it needs no Immich API key,
calls Immich read-only over the Docker network, and its entire route surface (confirmed by
reading its actual `src/index.ts`, not the README) is a closed set: `/share/:key`, `/s/:key`
(short alias), its own static assets, and a catch-all 404. Because that surface is
self-contained and safe by construction, it's fine to Funnel the *whole proxy app* rather
than trying to sub-scope it further:

```yaml
# Added alongside immich-server etc. in the same docker-compose.yml / network
immich-public-proxy:
  container_name: immich_public_proxy
  image: alangrainger/immich-public-proxy:3.0.2
  environment:
    IMMICH_URL: http://immich-server:2283       # reach the app by Compose service name
    PUBLIC_BASE_URL: https://<host>.<tailnet>:8443
  ports:
    - '127.0.0.1:3000:3000'                     # loopback only, same Gotcha 1 rule applies
  depends_on:
    - immich-server
  restart: always
```

```bash
# On the VM itself -- a second, narrow Funnel on its own port, same pattern as
# Grafana's /health and n8n's /webhook proxies elsewhere in this fleet. The app's
# main Serve URL (port 443) is completely untouched by this.
tailscale funnel --bg --https=8443 http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Then set the app's own "external domain" setting (Immich: Administration → Settings →
Server settings → External Domain — not a guessable UI path, verify live rather than assume;
it moves between versions) to the Funnel URL, so the app's own "Copy Link" button generates
a working public URL directly instead of needing the domain hand-edited after copying.

**Verify from a genuinely external vantage** (not a tailnet member — see the n8n-webhook
precedent for why "this Mac" and the Ansible control node both fail as test vantage points):
the proxy's own healthcheck returns `200`; a direct probe at the app's real API through the
*same* Funnel port 404s (proves the proxy's catch-all, not the app, is what's answering); an
invalid/garbage share key also 404s cleanly rather than leaking anything or crashing.

## Gotcha 5 — a shared Ansible `file` loop can silently drift a security-sensitive directory's mode

Grouping "ensure these directories exist" into one loop with one shared `mode:` is a natural
simplification when scaffolding a data disk's subdirectories (`library/`, `postgres/`, etc.
in Immich's case) — but if the directories have genuinely different sensitivity
requirements, a mode chosen for one silently overwrites the other every time the play re-runs.
Concretely: `mode: '0755'` was fine for Immich's photo-library directory but wrong for its
Postgres data directory (Postgres data dirs must stay `0700`, non-group/world-accessible).
Re-running the install playbook for an unrelated change (adding the proxy sidecar above)
silently flipped the live `postgres/` directory to `0755` on disk — harmless immediately only
because the already-running Postgres container wasn't restarted by that same apply (it only
validates data-directory permissions at startup), but a future restart/reboot would have hit
it. **Split into separate `file` tasks per directory once their required modes diverge**,
even if it means a few more lines — a shared loop is only safe when every item genuinely
wants the same mode. Caught here via a routine `--check --diff` before applying (see the
`dry-run-before-scoped-playbook-test` habit), which is what surfaced the pre-existing drift
in the first place, not something specific to this change.

## Gotcha 6 — a bridge-mode container's `127.0.0.1` is its own loopback, not the host's

A compose stack that mixes `network_mode: host` (for a service that genuinely needs to bind
real host ports, e.g. Pi-hole needing raw port 53) with plain bridge-mode services (the
default, e.g. a monitoring tool like Uptime Kuma with a normal `ports:` mapping) has two
*different* loopback namespaces in play. From inside a bridge-mode container, `127.0.0.1`
resolves to that container's own loopback — never the Docker host's — so a monitor/health-check
configured to hit `127.0.0.1:<port>` for a *different*, host-networked service in the same
compose file will fail to connect, even though both containers are "on the same box" and even
in the same `docker compose` project. Confirmed 2026-08-27: an Uptime Kuma DNS monitor
(bridge-mode, default `ports: - "127.0.0.1:3001:3001"`) targeting Resolver Server `127.0.0.1`
for a host-networked Pi-hole container on the same host failed outright — fixed by pointing the
monitor at the host's real LAN IP instead, which bridge-mode containers *can* reach (Docker's
default bridge networking routes out to the host's real interfaces/LAN fine, it's specifically
the host's loopback-bound services that are unreachable this way). The fix is either point
cross-service checks at a real IP (LAN or the Docker bridge gateway) instead of `127.0.0.1`, or
put every service in the stack on `network_mode: host` if they all need to talk to each other
via true host loopback — don't assume `127.0.0.1` means the same thing everywhere in a mixed
bridge/host compose file.

## Backup: a Docker-Compose VM usually wants a full, unexcluded vzdump

Unlike Jellyfin's bulky, reproducible-from-elsewhere media mount (`backup=false` on that
`mount_point`, see `proxmox-pbs-backup-job`), an app's Docker volumes are typically its *only*
copy of real user data (photo library + database, in Immich's case) — back up the whole VM,
no exclusions, same nightly `pvesh`-scheduled vzdump pattern as everything else in this fleet.
Verify with a real manual `vzdump` and confirm the transferred size is consistent with actual
data present (a mostly-empty data disk will report as heavily "sparse" — that's expected and
fine, not a sign of a broken backup).

## Verification: positive AND negative reachability, plus the real feature

1. `docker compose ps` — every container healthy.
2. Real data test: upload/create something through the actual app (not just a config check),
   confirm it processed (thumbnail, transcode, whatever the app's basic pipeline is).
3. The async-job check from Gotcha 2, if the app has one.
4. Tailscale Serve reachable from a genuine tailnet device.
5. **Negative check**: `nc -zv <lan-ip> <port>` (or `curl` with a timeout) from a different
   LAN host — expect refused/timeout, not a response. This is the only reliable proof Gotcha
   1 didn't slip through.
6. A real manual `vzdump` completes and the backup log doesn't show an unexpected exclusion.
