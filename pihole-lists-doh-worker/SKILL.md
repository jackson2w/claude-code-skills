description: This skill should be used when giving phones or tablets Pi-hole-style ad-blocking away from home without depending on a VPN/Tailscale tunnel. It covers serving Pi-hole's own lists as DNS-over-HTTPS from a Cloudflare Worker, iOS/iPadOS DNS-settings profiles (.mobileconfig) with SSID OnDemand rules, and the Worker's upstream (Cloudflare's security resolver over DoH since 2026-11-03; Quad9 DoT before).

# Pi-hole's lists as a DoH Worker (ad-blocking that survives tunnel stalls)

**Why:** with roaming DNS over Tailscale to a home Pi-hole, any tunnel stall kills all DNS (see
`tailscale-pihole-dns-routing`, the last section). This pattern takes the tunnel out of the DNS path but
keeps **Pi-hole as the only place lists are edited**.

## Shape

```
iPhone/iPad --iOS DNS profile (DoH)--> Cloudflare Worker --DoH (fetch)--> security.cloudflare-dns.com
                                         lists bundled in the Worker, committed nightly by the control node
home Wi-Fi: profile OFF by SSID rule --> Pi-hole on the LAN as before
```

- **The Worker** (RFC 8484, GET `?dns=` and POST `application/dns-message`) at `/dns-query/<device-token>`.
  - Allow (exact, then regex) wins; then exact deny or gravity; then regex deny. This is Pi-hole's order.
  - A blocked name answers `0.0.0.0` / `::` with TTL 2; any other record type gets an empty NOERROR.
    This is Pi-hole's NULL mode.
  - Homelab names (`*.jackson2w.dev`, `<dev>.<tailnet>.ts.net`) are answered from a synced
    `local.json`, because the device no longer uses Tailscale's DNS.
  - Upstream failure answers **SERVFAIL, never a fallback** (hard constraint #1).
- **Lists ship in the bundle**, not KV: 77k domains is about 1.6 MB, and the size limit is 64 MiB.
  - The control node commits `lists/` to the repo, and Workers Builds (Git-integrated) deploys the push.
  - **There's no Cloudflare API token anywhere.** Same pattern as the williejackson static site.
- **Tokens:** generated on the control node with `openssl rand ... | infisical-set.sh`. The repo holds only
  `sha256(token) -> device`. Rotate one by changing Infisical; the next sync locks the old token out.
- **Logging:** counts only (device, outcome, query type) in Analytics Engine.
  **Observability off:** request logs would store the URL, and the URL carries the token.
- **Guards in the sync:** refuse a blocklist under 10k entries or one that shrank more than 20%.
  `meta.generated_at` changes only when the content changes, so an unchanged night makes no commit.
- **Monitoring:** a 5-minute canary queries a blocked name, a normal name (this proves the upstream)
  and `/health` list age. Telegram after 2 consecutive failures, once per streak, plus on recovery.

## Gotchas (each one hit for real)

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| Quad9 DoH returns **505 HTTP Version Not Supported** | Quad9 has been **HTTP/2-only** for DoH since 2025-12-15 (port 5053 retired in May 2025). Worker `fetch()` to an outside server can't be relied on for h2. **Use DoT through `connect()` from `cloudflare:sockets`** (`secureTransport:"on"`, 2-byte length framing). Same upstream and protocol as Unbound. |
| Which upstream from a Worker? | **Benchmark from inside the Worker, not from a laptop.** DFW, 2026-11-03: Quad9 DoT p50 17 ms (a new TLS connection per query; a Worker can't keep a socket open between requests), Cloudflare DoH by `fetch()` p50 2 ms (same building), Quad9 DoH by `fetch()` 26–31 ms cold, 6 ms warm, with almost no reuse across requests. A Cloudflare upstream must be DoH: `connect()` to 1.1.1.1:853 fails with "Stream was cancelled" (sockets can't reach Cloudflare IPs). Privacy angle: the external resolver sees only the Worker's egress IP, so it adds a party seeing names without hiding the user's IP. |
| Live-test DNSSEC and upstream blocking | AD only comes back when the query sets **DO** (RFC 6840 §5.7): a plain query shows ad=0 on any resolver. Use `dnssec-failed.org` (expect SERVFAIL) and, for Cloudflare's security resolver, `malware.testcategory.com` (expect 0.0.0.0). Run the new suite against the **old** upstream first as a control. After a switch, cached answers from the old upstream last until their TTL plus one serve-stale refresh. |
| Upstream fails in `wrangler dev` but production is fine | The home LAN blocks outbound **853** for everything but Pi-hole (UniFi §6a). Prove forwarding against the deployed Worker. |
| Every request returns **403, "error code: 1010"** from a script, but curl works | Cloudflare's bot check rejects **Python-urllib's default User-Agent**. Set your own User-Agent in tests and the canary. iOS clients are unaffected. |
| `wrangler dev` won't start after `npm install` | npm 11 holds install scripts. Run `npm install-scripts approve workerd` then `npm rebuild workerd`. Pin wrangler to an exact version at least 2 weeks old. |
| Builds might fail after the dashboard connect | The dashboard named the Worker after the repo (`roaming-dns-worker`). Make `wrangler.jsonc` `name` match. |
| "Protect with Cloudflare Access?" | **No.** An iOS DNS profile holds only a URL: no login, no headers. Access would redirect every query and kill DNS. The path token is the access control. |
| Profile installed, but the device still queries Pi-hole over 100.x | (1) On an unsupervised device the profile must be **selected under Settings > General > VPN & Device Management > DNS**. (2) Tailscale's DNS overrides it, so turn off **Tailscale > Settings > "Use Tailscale DNS settings"** on that device only. Proof: the device's 100.x queries disappear from Pi-hole while it's on cellular. |
| `gh repo create` worked but a later `git pull` says "could not read Username" | Run `gh auth setup-git` once on the host. |

## The iOS profile

`com.apple.dnsSettings.managed`, `DNSProtocol: HTTPS`, `ServerURL: <worker>/dns-query/<token>`.
`OnDemandRules` are `[{Action: Disconnect, SSIDMatch: [home SSIDs]}, {Action: Connect}]`. Use every
SSID that gets Pi-hole: here AMPJ5, AMPJ4712 and AMPJ-IoT.

**Delivery without the token touching chat:**
- `infisical-wrapper.sh roaming-dns-profile.sh <device>` on ansible-ctrl writes it with plistlib.
- It serves the profile through a loopback Python server with
  `Content-Type: application/x-apple-aspen-config` (Safari then offers to install it).
  The server serves only that one file.
- Exposure is `tailscale serve --https=8443` (tailnet only), switched off by a 2-hour systemd timer.
- The first request may take a few seconds while Serve gets its certificate.

**Acceptance test:** on cellular with **Tailscale fully off**, sites load and ads are blocked.
`test/doh-test.py` in the repo has 19 positive and negative checks; the token goes in `DOH_TOKEN`
(env), never argv.

**Known differences from Pi-hole:** no CNAME deep inspection, and groups are ignored.

## Answer cache (added 2026-11-02): build it, it pays

**Don't skip the cache on the theory that the client already caches by TTL.** On this fleet, Pi-hole
answered about 78% of an iPhone's lookups from cache, and half of those were *stale* hits (Pi-hole's
optimistic serving). A Worker without a cache pays the upstream round trip (+20-50 ms) on every one.
Check the resolver's own data first: FTL `query_storage.status` 3 = cache, 17 = stale cache,
`reply_time` per query.

Pattern (`roaming-dns-worker/src/cache.js`, 17 node:test cases with a fake clock, upstream and edge):

- **Key:** `name|qtype|qclass|DO bit|CD bit`. The DO bit lives in the OPT record's TTL field.
- **Cache only NOERROR and NXDOMAIN without TC.** Negative TTL = min(SOA TTL, SOA MINIMUM). Clamp to
  1 day. TTL 0 means don't cache.
- **Serving:** copy the bytes, set the asker's ID, copy the asker's question bytes (mixed case), and
  rewrite every non-OPT TTL (age-decremented, or 30 when stale).
- **Serve-stale for up to a day,** with one background refresh per key via `ctx.waitUntil`. A failed
  refresh keeps the old entry.
- **Two layers:** the isolate's Map (LRU, 10k entries), then `caches.default`.
- **The Cache API works on `*.workers.dev`** (verified 2026-11-02 with a real put then match, reported
  by `/health` as `edge_cache`), even though the docs only promise it on custom domains. Measure it;
  don't move to a custom domain on the docs' word.
- **Add an `x-cache: hit|stale|miss` response header.** It's the only cheap way to see the cache
  working from outside when Analytics Engine has no reader.
- **Live stale test:** find a name with a TTL of a few seconds (www.microsoft.com was 2 s), ask once,
  sleep past its TTL, then ask three times. You should see hit, then stale with TTL 30, then hit.
- **Benchmark interleaved** (blocked, cached, unique names, round-robin) over one kept-alive
  connection. Back-to-back batches pick up network drift: one run showed blocked names at 57 ms
  against 31 ms interleaved.

## Per-device rollout and proof (iPad and iPhone, 2026-11-02)

Steps on each device, after installing the profile from the temporary tailnet-only link:
1. Under Settings > General > VPN & Device Management > DNS, **select** the profile. iOS shows it as
   "Unknown"; that's normal.
2. In the Tailscale app, turn off **Use Tailscale DNS settings**. The app then shows an
   "Advanced DNS Settings" page (None / Automatic / Custom). Leave it on **Automatic**; that page
   only appears when Tailscale DNS is off.
3. **Prove it on cellular with two Safari loads:** a blocked name (`doubleclick.net`) should fail with
   "can't connect", and a homelab name only the Worker knows (`grafana.jackson2w.dev`) should load
   over the tunnel. "No more Pi-hole queries from the device's 100.x address" proves only where
   lookups stopped going. It can't tell the Worker apart from a silent fallback to carrier DNS.
4. Take the profile link down (`roaming-dns-profile.sh --stop`). Pi-hole's per-minute counts for the
   device's 100.x address should stop at the moment Tailscale DNS was turned off.

## Blocked-answer TTL: 300 s, not Pi-hole's 2 s

Pi-hole uses 2 s so allowlist edits apply instantly. The Worker's lists only change at the nightly
sync, so 2 s just makes apps re-ask for blocked trackers (more requests, more radio wake-ups). The
DoH test asserts the 300. Keep the sync **nightly** even though blocklists change weekly: it only
deploys on a content-hash change, and it's what makes the owner's own allow/deny edits follow the
device by the next morning.
